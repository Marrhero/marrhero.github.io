                    <p>Chroma is a high intensity color matching puzzle game released in 2019 on Android. The game was developed with C# in the Unity Game Engine. I worked on a two man team for the development of this game.
                        I acted as the lead artist and I was responsible for all aspects of the visual design. I created all the art assets and led the art direction of the game, working to create visual experiences that matched up
                        to the tracks created by our musician. The neon colors and flashy visual effects were specifically designed to give a high octane feel to the gameplay.
                    
                        I made use of the Unity Profiler to optimize the game's performance, and ensure that it ran smoothly on a variety of devices, especially low-end devices, without compromising the high fidelity audiovisual 
                        experience that we were aiming for. </p>

                <p>Blockhead was developed with the Cocos2d-x engine. Our goal was to create a challenging game, and we ended up with quite a few players competing for the top position on the Google Play leaderboard.
                    I was the lead artist and art director for the game, and I created all of the art with vector tools to give the game a friendly cartoony appearance that hid just how tough this game was to beat.

                <p>This was the first game I ever developed and shipped, as part of our two-person studio Indecyfer. The concept was simple enough; flick the spheres into the corresponding corner before they vanished. Despite it's simplicity, I learned a lot about the full cylce of game production.

            <p>In my spare time, I create small projects and experiments to expand my knowledge and to stay up to speed with the fast growing world of game development.
                By working on short projects, I can learn at a much faster rate than if I were to create a fully developed game every time Unity updated the Input system or Rendering Pipeline!
